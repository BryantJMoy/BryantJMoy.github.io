I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student in Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis. My fields of study are American politics and quantitative political methodology with a focus on causal inference, experiments, and measurement. Throughout my career, I intend to develop behavioral models of elite politics. In particular, I am working on a project to collect and analyze mayoral emails to reveal aspects of the internal decision-making process and responsiveness to citizens. <br />

Before enrolling at Washington University in St. Louis, I graduated with a bachelor’s and master’s degree in Political Science from Arkansas State University. My master’s thesis explored the relationship between economic freedom and participatory democracy.  <br />
