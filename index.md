I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis. My fields of study are American Politics and Political Methodology, with a focus on causal inference and experiments. Throughout my career, I intend to develop models of representation in the local context. My dissertation, in particular, explores how changes in the ideological preferences of city residents translate to changes in local public policy. I will examine this relationship under different institutional and political contexts.<br />

Along side my dissertation project, I am collecting and analyzing mayoral emails in hopes of revealing aspects of the internal decision-making process in local government. <br />


My writing and research can be found in the *Oxford Bibliographies in Political Science*, and forthcoming in  *Political Behavior.*  <br />

<!--- I have experience working with national voter datasets and building large relational databases. I mainly use R to clean and analyze data, and SQL to manage large relational databases.-->

Before enrolling at Washington University in St. Louis, I graduated with a bachelor’s and master’s degree in Political Science from Arkansas State University. My master’s thesis explored the relationship between economic freedom and participatory democracy.  <br />

<!--- My writing and research has been published in the Journal of Experimental Political Science, Political Behavior, and Oxford Bibliographies in Political Science.-->
