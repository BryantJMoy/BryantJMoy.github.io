I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis. My fields of study are American politics and quantitative political methodology with a focus on causal inference and experiments. Throughout my career, I intend to develop models that explain responsiveness and representation in local government. I am also interested in the politics surrounding the provision of local public goods. I am involved in multiple projects pursuing these interests. In one project, I plan to generate dynamic public opinion on the municipal level to examine the extent to which these small-scale democracies are responsive over time to changing ideological distribution of city residents. In another project, I am collecting and analyzing mayoral emails to reveal aspects of the internal decision-making process within city government and understand how mayors respond to their constituents.   <br />

Before enrolling at Washington University in St. Louis, I graduated with a bachelor’s and master’s degree in Political Science from Arkansas State University. My master’s thesis explored the relationship between economic freedom and participatory democracy.  <br />
