I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis. My fields of study are American Politics and Political Methodology. Throughout my career, I intend to develop models of representation and responsiveness in the local government context. My dissertation, in particular, asks whether dynamic responsiveness exists on the local level and how the quality of representation varies across geographies and contexts.  <br />

While my dissertation project examines ideological responsiveness, I have another project dedicated to responsiveness to open records requests. I conducted a non-deceptive experiment on city executives to understand how we can foster greater responsiveness to requests for transparency. Alongside this project, I am collecting and analyzing mayoral emails in hopes of revealing aspects of the internal decision-making process.  <br />

My writing and research can be found in the *Oxford Bibliographies in Political Science*, *Political Behavior*, and the *Journal of Experimental Political Science.*  <br />

<!--- I have experience working with national voter datasets and building large relational databases. I mainly use R to clean and analyze data, and SQL to manage large relational databases.-->

Before enrolling at Washington University in St. Louis, I graduated with a bachelor’s and master’s degree in Political Science from Arkansas State University. My master’s thesis explored the relationship between economic freedom and participatory democracy.  <br />
