I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis. I am a scholar of American politics and political methodology interested in the functioning of democracy and how the local context shapes it. My research spans both institutions and political behavior with a central focus on local politics. The questions I seek to answer speak to democratic representation, elite behavior, and race & ethnic politics. In addition to my substantive areas, I have methodological interests in computational methods, experimental design, and causal inference using observational data. 
My dissertation addresses fundamental questions about how citizens shape policy in American local democracy: do local governments translate public opinion to public policy despite a system of overlapping governing institutions; can individuals foster greater responsiveness and transparency among local elites; and how do elites respond to rapid diversification of their constituents.  <br />

My writing and research can be found in the *Oxford Bibliographies in Political Science*, *Political Behavior*, and the *Journal of Experimental Political Science*.  In addition, a portion of my dissertation work received the Best Graduate Student Poster Award (Applications) from the Society of Political Methodology Summer Conference in 2021.  <br />

Before enrolling at Washington University in St. Louis, I graduated with a bachelor’s and master’s degree in Political Science from Arkansas State University. My master’s thesis explored the relationship between economic freedom and participatory democracy.  <br />
