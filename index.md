I am an incoming Data Science Faculty Fellow in the Center for Data Science and an Assistant Professor of Politics at New York University.  I am a scholar of American politics and political methodology interested in local politics, race, and data science. My research primarily focuses on how small-scale multi-racial democracies (cities) in the United States function in a complex environment. The questions I seek to answer speak to democratic representation, elite behavior, and race & ethnic politics. In addition to my substantive areas, I have methodological interests in computational methods, experimental design, and causal inference using observational data. 

My dissertation addresses fundamental questions about how citizens shape policy in American local democracy: do local governments translate public opinion to public policy despite a system of overlapping governing institutions; can individuals foster greater responsiveness and transparency among local elites; and how elites respond to diversity in their community.

My writing and research can be found in the *Oxford Bibliographies in Political Science*, *Political Behavior*, and *the Journal of Experimental Political Science.* In addition, a portion of my dissertation work received the Best Graduate Student Poster Award (Applications) from the Society of Political Methodology Summer Conference in 2021.  

In 2022, I graduated with a Ph.D. in Political Science from Washington University in St. Louis. Before enrolling at Washington University in St. Louis, I graduated with a bachelor’s and master’s degree in Political Science from Arkansas State University. My master’s thesis explored the relationship between economic freedom and participatory democracy.
