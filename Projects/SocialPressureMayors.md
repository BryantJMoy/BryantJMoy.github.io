**Can Social Pressure Foster Responsiveness? An Open Records Field Experiment with Mayoral Offices**

  
This paper examines the extent to which social pressures can foster more responsiveness among public officials. I conduct a non-deceptive field experiment on 1400 city executives across all 50 states and measure their level of responsiveness to open records requests. I use two messages to prime social pressure. The first treatment centers on the norm and duty to be responsive to the public’s request for transparency. The second treatment is grounded in the peer effects literature, which suggests that individuals change their behavior in the face of potential social sanctioning and accountability. I find no evidence that mayors are affected by priming the officials’ duty to the public. The mayors who received the peer effects prime were 6-8 percentage points less likely to respond, which suggests a ‘backfire effect.’ This paper contributes to the growing responsiveness literature on the local level and the poten- tial detrimental impact of priming peer effects.
