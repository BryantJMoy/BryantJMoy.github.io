# Can Social Pressure Foster Responsiveness? An Open Records Field Experiment with Mayoral Offices

  
This paper examines the extent to which social pressures can foster more responsiveness among public officials. I conduct a non-deceptive field experiment on 1400 city executives across all 50 states and measure their level responsiveness to open records requests. I use two messages to prime social pressures. The first centers on the duty to be responsive to the public's request for transparency. The second treatment is grounded in the peer effects literature, which suggests that individuals will change their behavior in the face of peer monitoring or social accountability. I find no evidence that mayors are affected by priming the officials' duty to the public. The mayors who received the peer effects prime, however, were 6-8% less likely to respond and were also 17% slower at responding to requests. I explore potential explanations for this unexpected result and discuss rival hypotheses. This paper contributes to the growing responsiveness literature on the local government level and the potential detrimental impact of priming peer effects.
